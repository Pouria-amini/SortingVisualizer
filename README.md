<h2>SORTVIZ<br>Sorting Visualization Application</h2>

An educational game created with the help of swing and awt 
frameworks to teach the users how the sorting algorithms work in the 
world of the computers. The application will visualize the process of sorting 
to the user and helps them utilize their knowledge of sorting algorithms
to play various games one the application. The user has to play the games 
and earn points to be able to unlock different sorting algorithms. 



The sorting algorithms include:
* Bubble Sort
* Gnome Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Radix Sort
* Shell Sort
* Selection Sort

<h3>Coding Mechanism:</h3>
There are 11 main and 10 supporting classes forming this application.
The main classes include the primary functions of the application, and 
the other supporting classes include the sorting algorithms and the
games created for the application. Although new games and sorting 
algorithms can be added to the collection, further modification is required
on the main classes after doing so. Also, the description of each of the classes
is written using javadoc and comments. The "Version" in Javadoc corresponds to
the number of modifications made to that methode (Not modified methods after creation are version 1.1).
The exact position of the components of the game is determined using the <a href="https://netbeans.apache.org">Apache NetBeans IDE</a>
to make the game more precise and appealing.

Follow the below steps before running the 
program:
* Run the program through the "Main" class.
* If you wish to modify the classes and they are locked, in Intellij IDE, go to
  File/File Properties/Make File Writable.
* The Javadocs were written in HTML. I would recommend rendering them before reading (If not rendered beforehand).
* If you wish to test the application, use the "USERNAME: admin" and "PASSWORD: 1382" to login. This gives you full access to the features of the application.
